# Blender Lock Camera to View

A simple blender addon that adds a keyboard shortcut to the Lock camera to view option from the N Panel.
It adds the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+E That will move the view into the camera perspective, and locks it to the view.
Typing Ctrl+E again will unlock the cam from the view.

I made this small quality of life addon purely for my own use, but you are very welcome to grab it.

- Download lock_cam_to_view.py.
- In Blender go to Edit > Preferences > Addons.
- Click the install button and locate the lock_cam_to_view.py file.
- Check the box to enable the addon.
